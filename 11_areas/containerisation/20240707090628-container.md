# Containers

A container is a standard package of software that contains all
necessary application code (or an application binary), runtimes,
dependencies, and configuration files to run said application.

Containers leverage Linux kernel features such as
[[20240323145547-namespaces|namespaces]] and
[[20240323155522-cgroups|cgroups]] in order to isolate processes and
allocate resource (CPU, memory, disk etc.). This allows containers to
virtualise the operating system (usually Linux), which allows containers
to be more lightweight and portable when compared to virtual machines.
