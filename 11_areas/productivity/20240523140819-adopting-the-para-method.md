# Adopting the PARA method

Over the past few days I've consumed quite a lot of content about the
PARA method, mainly the BASB Podcast by Tiago Forte, as well as his
short YouTube playlist on the PARA method. It's given me a framework
that has allowed me to make writing easier (in theory at least) as I
don't need to overthink where things should be stored.

I've also restructured my `~/Documents` folder in a similar way and it's
immediately made searching through my files easier, as well as
highlighted missing files (e.g. contracts, agreements etc.) that I
should ideally have local copies of.

This has allowed me to archive my GitHub `notes` repository and replace
it with a `second-brain` one instead, which contains that public section
of my '*second brain*'.
