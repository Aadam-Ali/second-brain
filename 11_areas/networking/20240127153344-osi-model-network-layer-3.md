# OSI Model Network Layer (3)

The network layer facilitates the data transfer between two distinct
networks. It breaks `segments` from the transport layer into `packets`
when sending data and reassembles `packets` into `segments` when
receiving data.

The network layer is also responsible for routing, forwarding, and
addressing.

Network layer protocols include IP (Internet Protocol) and ICMP
(Internet Control Message Protocol).
