# Security (SAA-C03)

## Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)

* An attack that attempts to overwhelm an application to make it
  unavailable to end users
* There are various ways of doing this: large packet floods, a
  combination of reflection and amplification techniques, or using
  botnets
* A layer 4 DDoS attack is referred to as a SYN flood - to establish a
  TCP connection a 3-way handshake takes place; `client --SYN packet-->
  server, server --SYN-ACK--> client, client --ACK--> server`
* After the handshake is complete a TCP connection is established and
  applications start sending data using Layer 7 e.g. HTTP
* SYN flood - sends a large number of SYN packets and ignores SYN-ACKS
  causing the server to use resources awaiting the ACK
* Amplification attack - using a spoofed IP address to make requests to
  NTP, DNS servers etc. where they will send a response larger than the
  request to the spoofed IP address, usually done from multiple sources
* Layer 7 attack - when a web server receives a surge of GET or POST
  requests from a botnet

## CloudTrail

* Increases visibility of account activity e.g. management console
  actions and API calls
* What information do the logs include:
  * API call metadata
  * Identity of API caller
  * Time of API call
  * Source IP address of API caller
  * Request parameters
  * Response elements returned by service
* CloudTrail logs are stored in S3
* Provied near real time intrusion detection

## Shield

* Free DDoS protection
* Offers protection to services using ELB, CloudFront, and
  [[20230212133907-saa-c03-route-53|Route 53]]
* Protection against [[20240127153344-osi-model-network-layer-3|layer 3]] and
  [[20240127151903-osi-model-transport-layer-4|layer 4]]
* AWS Shield Advanced:
  * Provided enhanced protections for applications using the above
    services against larger and more complex attacks
  * Offers always-on, flow-based monitoring of network traffic,
    providing near real time notifications of DDoS attacks
  * Gives 24/7 access to the DDoS Response Team (DRT) to help mitigate
    layer 7 DDoS attacks (not protection)
  * Protects AWS bill from usage spikes observed during DDoS attacks
  * Costs \$3000 per month

## Web Application Firewall (WAF)

* WAF lets you monitor HTTP(S) traffic to CloudFront or an ALB
* WAF allows you to configure access to services
* If requests don't meet conditions e.g. source IP or query string
  parameters, CloudFront or the ALB will return a HTTP 403.
* WAF operates at layer 7
* Behaviours:
  * Allow all requests except those that are specified
  * Deny all requests except those that are specified
  * Count all requests that match the properties that you specify
* Valid condition characteristics:
  * Source IP address
  * Source country
  * Request headers
  * Presence of SQL code (protection against SQL injection)
  * Presence of a script (protection against XSS)
  * Strings present in the request or regex patterns

## GuardDuty

* Threat detection service which leverages machine learning to
  continuously monitor for malicious behaviour
* Features:
  * Alerts in both GuardDuty dashboard and EventBridge
  * Receives information from third parties about malicious domains and
    IP addresses
  * Monitors CloudTrail logs, VPC flow logs, and DNS logs
  * Centralise threat detection across multiple accounts
  * Automated responses using EventBridge and Lambda
  * Machine learning and anamoly detection
* Takes between 7-14 days to observe normal behaviour of an account
  before becoming active

  CloudTrail events and volume of DNS and VPC Flow Logs data

## AWS Firewall Manager

* A security management service that allows you to centrally set up and
  manage firewall rules across multiple accounts in AWS Organizations.

* Simplifies management of firewall rules across accounts
* Automatically enforces rules on new and existing resources across
  multiple accounts, ensuring compliance

## Macie

* Personally Idenitfiable Information (PII) is any personal data that
  can be used to establish an individual's identity
* Macie uses machine learning and pattern matching to discover sensitive
  data stored in S3
* Alerts:
  * Can filter and search Macie alerts in the management console
  * Alerts sent to EventBridge can be integrated with security incident
    and event management (SIEM) systems
  * Can be integrated with AWS Security Hub for a broader analysis of an
    organisation's security posture
  * Can be integrated with other AWS services such as Step Functions to
    automatically take remediative actions.
* Useful for ensuring HIPPA and GDPR compliance

## Inspector

* An automated security assessment service that helps to improve
  security and compliance of applications deployed in AWS
* Inspector automatically assesses applications for vulnerabilities and
  deviations from best practices
* Findings can be reviewed directly or as part of detailed assessment
  reports via the management console, or API
* Assessment types:
  * Network assessments - analyses network confiugration to check for
    ports reachable from outside the VPC, agentless
  * Host assessments - Checks for CVEs, host hardening (CIS Benchmarks),
    security best practices, requires an agent
* How does it work?
  * Create assessment target
  * Install agents on EC2 instances
  * Create assessment template
  * Perform assessment run
  * Review findings against rules

## Key Management Service (KMS)

* A managed service that simplifies the creation and management of
  encryption keys
* Integrates with service such as EBS, S3, and RDS to encrypt data with
  KMS keys
* Can control lifecycle and permissions of keys as well as access
  control
* Customer master key (CMK) - logical representation of a master key,
  includes metadata such as key ID, creation date, key state etc.
* CMK contains the key material used to encrypt and decrypt data
* Hardware security module (HSM) - a physical computing device that
  safeguards and manages digital keys and performs encryption and
  decryption; contains one or more secure cryptoprocessor chips
* Ways to generate CMKs:
  * AWS creates it for you, material generated within HSMs managed by KMS
  * Import key material from your own key management infrastructure and
    associate it with a CMK
  * Have the key material generated and used in an AWS CloudHSM cluster
    as part of the customer key store feature in KMS
* If using method one, you can have CMKs automatically rotate yearly
* Automatic key rotation is not supported for the other two methods
* Access to CMKs are managed using resource policies called key policies
* Managing permissions:
  * Key policy
  * IAM policy in conjunction with key policy
  * Grants in conjunction with key policy
* KMS vs CloudHSM:
  * KMS is shared tenancy, CloudHSM includes dedicated HSM (full
    control)
  * KMS offers automatic key rotation, CloudHSM does not
  * KMS has automatic key generation
  * CloudHSM provides full control of users, groups, keys etc.

## Secrets Manager

* Secrets Manager is a service that securely stores, encrypts, and
  rotates secrets including database credentials
* Fully encrypted using KMS
* Granular access control using IAM policies
* High cost but is highly scalable
* If you enable rotation, Secrets Manager will immediately rotate the
  secret once to test the configuration
* Do not enable rotation for hard coded credentials

## Parameter Store

* Provides secure, hierarchical storage for configuration data and
  secrets management
* Data can be stored as plain text or encrypted values
* Parameter store is free, however, there is a limit of 10,000
  parameters
* Parameters cannot be automatically rotated

## Temporarily Share S3 Objects

* All S3 objects are private by default but can be shared by creating a
  presigned URL
* To create a presigned URL you must provide security credentials,
  bucket name and an object key, expiration date, and HTTP method
* Anyone with access to the presigned URL can access the files
* Presigned cookies can be used when you want to share mulitple files
  from a private bucket

## Advanced IAM Policy Documents

* All ARNs begin `arn:partition:service:region:account_id:...`
* [[20221121205221-saa-c03-identity-and-access-management-iam|IAM]] Policies:
  * A JSON document that defines permissions
  * Identity policy - a policy that is attached to users and groups
  * Resource policy - a policy that is attached to resources
  * Contains a list of statements, which match AWS API requests
* Permission boundaries:
  * Used to delegate administration to other users
  * Prevent privelege escalation or broad permissions
  * Control maximum permissions an IAM policy can grant

## Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM)
