# Migration (SAA-C03)

## How To Migrate Data?

* Over the internet - utilising an existing connection
* Direct Connect - faster than over the internet, however, impractical
  if connection is not required after migration
* Physical - physically delivering data via hardware storage medium

## Snow Family

* AWS Snow Family is a set of secure appliances that provide
  petabyte-scale data collection and processing solutions at the edge
  and migrate large-scale data in and out of AWS
* Snow Family offers built-in computing capabilities, allowing customers
  to run operations in remote location which lack data centre access or
  reliable network connections
* Snowcone:
  * 8TB of storage, 4GB of memory, 2 vCPUs
  * Easily migrate data to AWS after it's been processed
  * IoT sensor integration
  * Optimal for edge computing
* Snowball Edge:
  * 48TB - 81TB storage
  * Storage, Compute, and GPU options
  * Varying amount of CPU and RAM
  * Optimal for off-the-grid computing or migrating to AWS
* Snowmobile:
  * 100PB of storage
  * Designed for exabyte-scale data center migration
* Snow Family is useful for migrating data that needs to be encrypted at
  rest and in transit
* Generally, data migration takes around a week

## Storage Gateway

* AWS Storage Gateway is a service that connects an on-prem software
  appliance with cloud-based storage to provide seamless and secure
  integration between your on-prem IT environment and the AWS storage
  infrastructure in the AWS Cloud
* Storage Gateway runs on-prem as a VM
* File Gateway:
  * NFS or SMB mount
  * Backup all data or a cache copy of recently used files
  * Extend on-prem storage (particularly useful if local storage if
    full)
  * Aid migrations to AWS
* Volume Gateway:
  * iSCSI mount
  * Cached or stored mode
  * Create EBS snapshots
  * Optimal for backup or migration
* Tape Gateway:
  * Replace physical tapes
  * Doesn't change current workflow
  * Encrypted communication

## AWS DataSync

* AWS DataSync is an online data movement and discovery service that
  simplifies data migration and helps you quickly, easily, and securely
  transfer your file or object data to, from, and between AWS storage
  services
* Agent-based solution (not required for migration between AWS services
  in the same account)
* Optimal for a one time migration
* Supports data being migrated to S3, EFS, and FSx

## AWS Transfer Family

* AWS Transfer Family is a secure transfer service that enables you to
  transfer files into and out of AWS storage services (S3 or EFS)
* Transfer Family uses the SFTP, FTPS, or FTP protocol to transfer data
* Only SFTP and FTPS are permitted for transfers originating from
  outside of the AWS account
* Generally used for legacy applications

## AWS Migration Hub

* AWS Migration Hub (Migration Hub) provides a single place to discover
  your existing servers, plan migrations, and track the status of each
  application migration. The Migration Hub provides visibility into your
  application portfolio and streamlines planning and tracking. You can
  visualize the connections and the status of the servers and databases
  that make up each of the applications you are migrating, regardless of
  which migration tool you are using
* Migration Hub integrates with Server Migration Service (SMS) and
  Database Migration Service (DMS)
* Server Migration Service, simply put, migrates on-prem VMs to AWS by
  uploading volumes and converting them to EBS snapshots
* Database Migration Service migrates Oracle or SQL Server databases to
  an Aurora Database using the AWS Schema Conversion Tool
* Migration phases:
  * Discover phase - find servers and databases to plan migrations
  * Migrate phase - connect tools to Migration Hub, and start migrating
  * Track phase - follow migration progress and statuses

## AWS Server Migration Service (SMS)

* AWS SMS automates the migration of on-prem servers to AWS
* Supports vSphere, Hyper-V, SCVMM, and Azure VMs
* Creates incremental replicas of server VMs, and converts them to AMIs
  that can be deployed to [[20221204122753-saa-c03-elastic-cloud-compute-ec2|EC2]]
* Handles volume replication
* Can schedule replication intervals as you wish and track the progress
  of server groups as they migrate
* Due to incremental migrations, allows quick testing of migrated
  servers
* Minimises downtime that would usually occur during migrations

## AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)

* AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) is a cloud service that makes
  it possible to migrate relational databases, data warehouses, NoSQL
  databases, and other types of data stores
* Can migrate database between AWS and on-prem (one party of the
  migration must be within AWS)
* Either perform a one-time migration or replicate ongoing changes
  continuously
* Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) allows the translation of database
  schemas between platforms
* Gain advantages of AWS e.g. cost, efficiency, security etc.
* How DMS works:
  1. Create source and target connections
  2. Schedule tasks to run on the DMS server to migrate data
  3. AWS creates the tables and primary keys (if they do not exist) -
     optionally, you can create the tables beforehand
  4. Leverage the SCT for creating some or all of the tables, indexes
     etc.
  5. Source and target are referred to as endpoints
* Data can easily between migrated to the same engine
* Data can be migrated between different engines
* Migration types:
  * Full Load migration - all existing data is moved from sources to
    targets in parallel, changes made during this migration are cached on
    the replication server
  * Full Load and Change Data Capture (CDC) - the above, except changes
    made during migration are captured (only type to guarantee
    transactional integrity)
  * CDC Only - Only replicate the data changes from the source databases
* Migrate large data stores (>= TBs) with AWS Snowball
  * Can still leverage the SCT
  * DMS can load extracted data from S3 and migrate to a target
  * Also CDC compatible

## AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT)

* You can use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) to convert your
  existing database schema from one database engine to another
* Can convert many types of relational databases, including OLAP and
  OLTP, as well as data warehouses
* Converted schemas can target and support RDS engine type, Aurora, or
  Redshift
* Converted schemas can be used with DBs running on EC2, or data stored
  in S3

## AWS Application Discovery Service (ADS)

* AWS Application Discovery Service helps you plan your migration to the
  AWS cloud by collecting usage and configuration data about your
  on-premises servers and databases
* ADS integrates with AWS Migration Hub - simplifying migrations and
  tracking their statuses
* You can view the discovered servers, group them into applications, and
  then track the migration status of each application
* AWS offers two discovery types - agentless and agent based
* Agentless:
  * Complete by the Agentless Collector (an OVA file in VMware vCenter)
  * Identifies hosts and VMs in vCenter
  * Tracks and collects IP and MAC addresses, resources allocations, and
    hostnames
  * Collects utilisation data metrics
* Agent Based:
  * Deploy the AWS Application Discovery Agent
  * Install on each VM and physical server
  * Installer available for Windows and Linux
  * Collects a wider range of data e.g. static config data, time-series
    performance information, network connections, and OS processes

## AWS Application Migration Service (MGN)

* AWS Application Migration Service (MGN) is a highly automated
  lift-and-shift (rehost) solution that simplifies, expedites, and
  reduces the cost of migrating applications to AWS
* Can be used to migration physical, virtual, or cloud servers avoiding
  disruptions
* Replicates servers into AWS
* Recovery Time Objective (RTO) - usually just minutes; depends on OS
  boot time
* Recovery Point Objective (RPO) - measure in the sub-second range
