# Monitoring (SAA-C03)

## CloudWatch Overview

* System level metrics e.g. [[20221204122753-saa-c03-elastic-cloud-compute-ec2|EC2]]
  instance monitoring
* Application level metrics - can be collected by installing CloudWatch
  agent
* Alarms will send alerts based on trends in the data collected
* The default time span of an alarm is 60 seconds
* Default metrics are provided out of the box and require no
  configuration e.g. CPU Utilisation and Network Throughput
* Custom metrics require the presence of the CloudWatch agent on the
  host e.g. EC2 Memory Utilisation and
  [[20221205171813-saa-c03-elastic-block-storage-ebs-elastic-file-system-efs|EBS]]
  Storage Capacity

## CloudWatch Logs

* Log events contain a record of what happened, timestamp and data
* Log streams contain a collection of log events from the same source
  e.g. single instance
* Log groups contain a collection of log streams e.g. all instances
* Filter patterns allow you to look for particular values in your logs
* CloudWatch Logs Insights allow you to query logs similar way to SQL
* Alarms will send alerts based on trends in logs
* When logs don't need to be processed they should be sent straight to
  [[20221203141054-saa-c03-simple-storage-service-s3|S3]]
* Requires the CloudWatch agent to be configured on the host

## AWS Managed Grafana

* AWS Managed Grafana is a fully managed service allowing for the instant
  querying, correlating, and visualising of metrics, logs, and traces
* Makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale Grafana in AWS
* Workspaces (individual Grafana servers) allow for the seperation of
  data visualisations and queries
* Fully managed by AWS therefore no need to worry about maintenance
* Provides built in security features to assist in meeting governance
  and compliance requirements
* Pricing is based on per active user in a workspace
* Integrates with multiple AWS services, including but not limited to:
  CloudWatch, AWS Managed Prometheus, OpenSearch, and Timestream
* Use Cases:
  * Use Prometheus to visualise metrics of container workloads (ECS,
    EKS)
  * Plugins facilitate the monitoring of IoT and edge device data
  * Centralised dashboards make troubleshooting more efficient

## AWS Managed Prometheus

* AWS Managed Prometheus is a serverless, Prometheus compatible service
  used for securely monitoring container metrics at scale
* Able to use the Prometheus data model
* Automatic scaling managed by AWS based on ingestion, storage, and
  querying of metrics
* HA design means data is replicated across AZs within a region
* Compatible with EKS or self-managed Kubernetes clusters
* Can use the open source PromQL to analyse and extract data
* Workspaces retain data for 150 days (after which data is automatically
  deleted)
