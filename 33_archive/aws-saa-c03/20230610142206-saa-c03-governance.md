* Savings Plans types:
  * Compute Savings - most flexible, applies to EC2 compute, Lambda, or
    Fargate usage, upto 66% savings
  * EC2 Instance Savings - stricter plans, applies to EC2 instances of a
    specific family in specific regions, upto 72% savings
  * SageMaker Savings - applies to all SageMaker instances in any
    region, applies to any component, upto 64% savings
