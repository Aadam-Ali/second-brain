# Databases (SAA-C03)

## Relational Database Service (RDS) Fundamentals

* RDS supports six database engines: SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL,
  PostgreSQL, MariaDB, and Amazon Aurora
* RDS is for OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) workloads
* Not suitable for OLAP (Online Analytical Processing), use Redshift

## Multi AZ vs Read Replica

* Multi AZ
  * An exact copy of a database in another AZ
  * Used for disaster recovery
  * In the event of a failure, RDS will automatically fail over to the
    standby instance
* Read Replica
  * A read only copy of a primary database in the same AZ, cross AZ, or
    cross region
  * Used to increase or scale read performance
  * Used for read heavy workloads to reduce load on primary database
* Related: [[20230309161615-saa-c03-high-availability-and-scaling|HA and scaling]]

## Amazon Aurora

* 2 copies of data are stored in each AZ, with minimum of 3 AZs (6
  copies)
* You can take snapshots and share them with other AWS accounts
* 3 types of replicas available: Aurora, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, automated
  failover is only available for Aurora replicas
* Aurora has automated backups enabled by default
* Use Aurora serverless for a cost effective option for unpredictable
  workloads

## DynamoDB

* Stored on SSD storage
* Spread across 3 geographically distinct data centre
* Eventually consistent reads by default, but strongly consistent is
  available

## DynamoDB Transactions

* Provides ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability)
  across 1 or more tables withing a single account and region
* All-or-nothing transactions, either inserts or does not

## DynamoDB Backups

* On Demand Backups
  * Full backups at any time with no impact on performance or
    availabilty
  * Consistent within seconds and retained until deleted
  * Operates in the same region as the source table
* Point in Time Recovery
  * Protection against accidental operations
  * Restore from 5 minutes ago - 35 days ago
  * Incremental backups
  * Not enabled by default

## DyanamoDB Global Tables

* Fully managed multi master, multi region replication
* Based on DynamoDB streams
  * Time ordered sequence of item-level changes in a table
  * Stored for 24 hours
  * Can be combined with Lambda for functionality like stored procedures
* Multi region redundancy for disaster recovery and high availability
* Replication latency is under 1 second

## DocumentDB

* Fully managed database service for MongoDB
* Migrate MongoDB database to AWS
  * On Prem -> AWS Database Migration Service -> DocumentDB

## Amazon Keyspaces

* Fully managed serverless database service for Apache Cassandra
* Used to migrate Apache Cassnadra to AWS

## Amazon Neptune

* Amazon's graph database service
  * Graph database contains nodes and relationships rather than tables
    and documents

## Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (QLDB)

* A fully managed ledger database
  * A ledger database contains a transparent, immutable, and
    cryptographically verifiable transaction log

## Amazon Timestream

* Fully managed, serverless database service for time-series data
  * Time-series data contain data points that are logged over a series
    of time e.g. temperature readings from weather stations
* Upto 1000 times faster at upto 1/10th of the cost of traditional
  relational databases
