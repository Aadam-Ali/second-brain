# Route 53 (SAA-C03)

## Overview

* A top level domain name (DN) is the last word in a domain name (e.g.
  com in google.com)
* A registrar is an authority that can assign DNs directly under one or
  more top level domains, which are then registered with InterNIC (an
  ICANN service), to enforce uniqueness of DNs

## DNS Record Types

* SOA (start of authority)
  * Name of the server that supplied the data for the zone
  * Administrator of the zone
  * Current version of the data file
  * Default number of seconds for the TTL on resource records
* NS (name server) contains information regarding where DNS information
  is stored
* A (address) records are used to translate the DN to an IP
  address
* CNAME (canonical name) records are used to resolve one DN to another,
  think subdomains
* Alias records (AWS specific) are used to map resource record sets in a
  hosted zone to [[20230305150147-saa-c03-elastic-load-balancing-elb|LBs]], CloudFront
  distributions, or static websites in
  [[20221203141054-saa-c03-simple-storage-service-s3|S3]]

## Registering a Domain Name

* Can buy DNs from AWS
* Can take upto 3 days for DN to register

## Routing Policies

* Simple - can only have one record with multiple IP addresses, if
  mulitple IP addresses are specified they are returned in a random
  order
* Weighted Routing - allows the splitting of traffic based on different
  weights assigned (e.g. x% to region a and y% to region b)
* Latency-Based - route traffic based on the lowest network latency for
  the end user
* Failover - used when you want to to have active/passive set up
* Geolocation - choose where traffic will be sent based on geographic
  location of users
* Geoproximity (Traffic Flow Only) - route taffic based on geographic
  location of users and resources, can choose to route more/less traffic
  based on a bias; requires traffic flow to be setup.
* Multivalue Answer - similar to simple, however, you can have multiple
  records and can use healthchecks

## Health Checks

* Can be set on individual record sets
* If a health check fails, the records set is removed until the health
  check passes
* Can configure SNS notifications to alert when health checks fail
