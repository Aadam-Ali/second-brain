# Second Brain

This repository contains the contents of what was once my notes
repository (https://github.com/Aadam-Ali) and will contain much more
going forward.

As of writing this, I have recently come across the concept of building
a second brain, and the PARA (projects, areas, resources, archive)
method. This idea comes from [Tiago Forte](https://fortelabs.com/), who
who has written books on both [Building a Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/book)
and the [PARA method](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/para), though I've not personally read them - one day I might get around to it. Most of my
inspiration has come from listening to both his [Building a Second Brain
podcast](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/podcast) and this [short YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6Mfl1OywM8&list=PLVNXAaej57W6qCYoMb_hbzDhX9et_GVlj&pp=iAQB)

I'd like to note that this is only the public part of my 'second brain',
which will contain any notes / collection of notes that I'm happy being
made publicly available. For the best experience for navigating these
notes I suggest using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) or
[Logseq](https://logseq.com/) (I've not tested Logseq extensively so it
might not be as smooth an experience as Obsidian).
